Starting GoLang again while learning som DSA

### Things I learned for Go

- When exporting in go functions and struct need to be capitalized
- How to index with array pointers

### Things I learned/relearned for DSA

- Big O explained (dropping constants)
- Linear/Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Deleting from linked list is constant time
- Similarities and Differences between Linked List and Arrays
  - Arrays are a set length regarless if you use the space or not while a linked list will only create new nodes when needed.
  - To access elements in a linked list you need to travers the whole thing vs array which you can index
- JS arrays are considered ArrayList with instant get/push/pop but have O(n) time for un/shift
